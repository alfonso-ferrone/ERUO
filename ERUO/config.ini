# ---------------------------------- CONFIGURATION FILE FOR ERUO -----------------------------------
# This file allows the modification of most of the parameters of the library, used in all three
# stages of the algorithm.
# The default values are the ones detailed in the manuscript that presents the ERUO library.
# The only values that absolutely need to be changed by the user are in the first section
# of this file: PATHS.
# The user is required to input the correct paths in which the original MRR-PRO files are stored,
# and the ones in which they desire to save any of the ERUO products.
# 
# Tip: set visualization to PYTHON syntax for an easier visualization of this file.
